# Daily-Planner

# Description

This assignment entailed making a responsive, color-coded daily planner that allows users to save notes/tasks in one-hour blocks from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (with those notes persisting in local storage). Aside from creating additional time blocks to fill the schedule, the HTML/CSS were fully formed in the starter code. The bulk of the work (adding an event listener for the time block save buttons, dynamically changing the colors of the time blocks based on the time of day, setting and retrieving user input from local storage) was done with jQuery in the custom JS file.
